# Preqin Private Markets Data Science Projects

This repository showcases three full-stack data science prototypes tailored to private markets analytics. These projects simulate the kind of ML pipelines and analytical tools developed at Preqin, a part of BlackRock.

Each project follows best practices for data modeling, transformation, and interpretability â€” and can be extended to real-world private equity, infrastructure, and hedge fund datasets.
